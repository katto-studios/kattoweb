This is a template on how to create a blog post!

See https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/ for a guide on how to format content with markdown.

# Heading Level 1

This is an example of a level 1 heading, or H1 heading.

## You might want to put another subheading with heading level 2

The number of hashtags determines the heading level all the way from h1, h2, h3 to h4, h5, and h6.

# Bullet Points

- Create bullet points
- With dashes

# Numbered Points

1. Numbered Points
2. Can be created
3. Like this

# Links

You can create links bu wrapping the link text in square brackets, followed by the url in parantheses like this: [link text](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

# Images

## Images from External Public Sources

You may use the following syntax to add images with external links: ![Alternate text for image](<link to image>).

For example:
![Google Cloud Services](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/spaculus/cdns/images/google-cloud-img.jpg)

## Using Your Own Images

Upload your own image in the `posts` folder within the `public` folder in the repository in a sub-directory with the name of your corresponding post.

Thereafter, you may use it in your post with the same syntax for example:
![RAiD Logo GIF](/posts/raid-landing-page/1.gif)
