In the quest for a greener future, innovation and collaboration have emerged as the cornerstones of progress. The latest stride in this journey comes from the partnership between JTC Corporation and Katto Studios, as they proudly unveil the Singapore Building Carbon Calculator (SBCC), a transformative tool poised to reshape the landscape of the built environment industry in Singapore.

## A Confluence of Vision: The Birth of SBCC

Grounded in a shared commitment to environmental responsibility, JTC Corporation, in collaboration with the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and the Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC), embarked on a mission to develop a cutting-edge solution that would empower the industry with the ability to make informed decisions about material and product selections based on their embodied carbon footprint. This ambitious endeavor found its foundation in the National University of Singapore's Energy Studies Institute (NUS-ESI), combining knowledge, expertise, and the drive to create meaningful change.

## Unveiling the SBCC: A Glimpse into the Future of Sustainability

At the heart of this collaboration stands the Singapore Building Carbon Calculator (SBCC). Born from the unified Building Embodied Carbon Calculator (BECC), the SBCC is more than just a tool; it's a revolutionary approach to sustainability in the built environment. With meticulous attention to detail and a focus on local context, the SBCC goes beyond standard calculations, accounting for the upfront carbon of materials and applying adapted carbon emission factors.

## Empowering Decision-Making

The SBCC isn't merely a calculator; it's an enabler of informed decisions. It arms industry professionals with the knowledge they need to make choices that resonate with environmental stewardship. Through its innovative features, including exportable reports, saved calculations, and shareable links for collaboration, the SBCC paves the way for a new era of conscientious design and construction.

## The Agile Journey: From Vision to Reality in 2 Months

Behind the scenes, the creation of the SBCC was a testament to the power of agile development and user-centricity. Over a span of just two months, the project transformed from a vision into a fully functional MVP. The process kicked off with a deep dive into user discovery, seeking to understand the needs and pain points of industry professionals.

## User-Centric Design: Pioneering Change, One Insight at a Time

The heart of any successful project lies in understanding its users. Through rigorous user discovery, the teams at JTC Corporation and Katto Studios delved into the world of architects, engineers, and builders. Their insights, challenges, and aspirations formed the bedrock upon which the SBCC was built. By placing the user at the center, the teams ensured that every feature, every function, and every pixel spoke directly to the needs of those who would rely on the tool.

## Agile Manifestation: Adapting to Evolve

In the swift realm of software development, agility is key. The SBCC project embraced this philosophy, iterating and evolving based on continuous feedback loops. The collaborative spirit between JTC Corporation and Katto Studios fostered an environment where ideas were shared, tested, and refined at a rapid pace. This dynamic approach allowed the project to not only meet but exceed expectations, delivering an MVP that encapsulated the essence of the vision.

## Pioneering Change: Greening the Future

As the Singapore Building Carbon Calculator takes its place in the spotlight, it symbolizes more than just a technical achievement. It stands as a testament to what can be achieved when innovation meets collaboration, when user-centric design is more than a phrase, and when sustainability isn't just a goal but a way of life. With SBCC, JTC Corporation and Katto Studios have set a new standard for the intersection of technology, sustainability, and human-centered design.

Let the journey to a greener, more sustainable future begin. The Singapore Building Carbon Calculator is more than a tool; it's a beacon of change lighting the path ahead.
