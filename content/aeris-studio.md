### Introduction

Aeris Studio is a rising keyboard company that creates stylish and affordable keyboards for all levels of experience. They approached us with the request to develop a thrilling web experience for their upcoming group buy of their first product, the Killer 65. The Killer 65 is a fully customizable keyboard that includes a top frame, bottom frame, and counter weight. It is designed for users who want to make their own unique keyboard with a wide range of customization options. Aeris Studio was excited to offer this product through a group buy, and they wanted to create a dynamic and engaging web experience for their customers to make the process as smooth and enjoyable as possible.

### Highlight Features

Through market research of our competitors' existing web pages and drawing inspiration from the product pages of tech giants like Apple and Huawei, we identified two main features that would make our site stand out.

1. An **animated landing page** that showcases the product through renders that animate as the user scrolls down the page. This will create a dynamic and engaging experience for visitors to the site, helping to capture their attention and interest in the killer65 keyboard.

2. An **in-store customizer** that allows customers to easily customize and purchase their desired configurations of the keyboard. This feature will provide a convenient and user-friendly way for customers to purchase the killer65, making the process smooth and enjoyable. By implementing these features, we hope to create a unique and memorable online experience for Aeris Studio's customers.

**Shopify Storefront API** allowed us to quickly integrate store-related features, allowing us to focus on building the customer experience.

**Chakra UI** is a library of reusable UI components that we will use to create a consistent and visually appealing design for our site, helping to create a cohesive and professional look and feel. By using these tools and technologies, we aim to build a high-quality and user-friendly web experience for Aeris Studio's customers.
